# Projects-Adm

Mobile App (developed in React Native) intended for projects administration from both points of view (customer and provider). Expo based app fully integrated with Firebase (authentication and backend services).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the project locally you must have:

```
-Homebrew v2.5.2 or higher (only for mac users) - Download here: https://brew.sh/index_es

-React Native Cli v2.0.1 or higher (for mac users: brew install react-native-cli)

### Installing

If you completed last step (or already had all installed in your machine), you can go on with the following instructions:

```
Inside repository folder run following commands:
- npm install
- npm start
It will pop up a browser with an EXPO tab that represent the current instance of the project running
```

For mobile debugging:

```
